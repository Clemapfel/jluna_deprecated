# jluna: A modern Julia тнд C++ Wrapper API (v0.5)

Julia is a beautiful language, it is well-designed and well-documented. Julias C-API is well-designed, less beautiful and much less... documented. Heavily inspired in software-design and syntax by [**sol3**](https://github.com/ThePhD/sol2), `jluna` aims to fully replace the official julia C-API in usage in C++ projects and makes accessing Julias unique strengths through C++ easy and hassle-free.

Some advantages `jluna` has over the C-API:
+ automatically detects and links julia during make
+ expressive, generic syntax
+ mutating C++-side proxies also assigns the corresponding variable julia-side if desired
+ verbose exceptions, including exception forwarding from julia
+ wraps many C++ std objects and types
+ multi-dimensional array interface
+ C++ keeps julia-side values safe from the garbage collector while in use
+ `jluna` is fully documented, including inline documentation for IDEs and tutorials
+ mixing the C-API and `jluna` is perfectly fine and `jluna` offers some C-extensions as glue-code

## Features:

For a "quick & dirty" tour of `jluna`s functionality, see the following examples:

### Initialization
```cpp
jluna::State::initialize(); // loads julia and jluna
```
```
[JULIA][LOG] initialization successfull.
```

### Accessing Julia-Side Variables
```cpp
// execute arbitrary string
jluna::State::safe_script(R"(
    module MyModule
        mutable struct MutableType
            _field
        end

        instance = MutableType(123)
    end
)");

// access variables with [] syntax
std::cout << (int) jluna::Main["MyModule"]["instance"]["_field"] << std::endl;

// or through script return
std::cout << (int) jluna::State::script("return MyModule.instance._field") << std::endl;
```
```
123
123
```

### Calling Julia Functions
```cpp
jluna::Function println = jluna::Base["println"];

// all primitive, all jluna:: and most std:: types can be used directly
println(std::string("this is a string "), "\n", 
        println, "\n",
        int(42), "\n",
        State::script("return [1, 2, 3]"));
```
```
this is a string 
println
42
[1, 2, 3]
```

### Modifying Julia-Side Variables

```cpp
jluna::State::safe_script(R"(
    module MyModule
        mutable struct MutableType
            _field
        end

        instance = MutableType(123)
    end
)");
jluna::State::safe_script(R"(println("before: ", MyModule.instance._field))");

auto field = jluna::Main["MyModule"]["instance"]["_field"];

// to modify both the proxy and the julia-side variable, we need to declare it mutating
jluna::make_mutating(field);

// after that any assign will affect both C++ and Julia-side memory
field = 456;

State::safe_script(R"(println("after: ", MyModule.instance._field))");
```
```
before: 123
after: 456
```

### Mulit-Dimensional Arrays
```cpp
using namespace jluna;
State::safe_script(R"(
    array = Array{Int64, 3}(reshape(collect(1:(3*3*3)), 3, 3, 3))
    vector = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
)");

// array of arbitary type and rank
Array<jluna::Int64, 3> array = Main["array"];

// access element
array[21] = 8888;         // linear indexing
array.at(0, 1, 2) = 9999; // 0-based multidimensional indexing

// vectors are an Array<T, 1> typedef with some extra functionality
Vector<int> vector = Main["vector"];
vector.push_front(0);
vector.push_back(10);

// both arrays and vectors are iterable
for (auto it : vector)
    it = it.operator int() + 10; // also assigns the julia-side array

State::safe_script(R"(println("array: ", array))");
State::safe_script(R"(println("vector: ", vector))");
```
```
array: [1 4 7; 2 5 8; 3 6 9;;; 10 13 16; 11 14 17; 12 15 18;;; 19 9999 25; 20 23 26; 21 24 27]
vector: [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
```

### Exception Forwarding
```cpp
jluna::State::safe_script("return this_value_is_undefined");
```
```
exception in jluna::State::safe_script for expression:
"return this_value_is_undefined"

terminate called after throwing an instance of 'jluna::JuliaException'
  what(): UndefVarError: this_value_is_undefined not defined

### And more!

### Planned (but not yet implemented):
In order of priority, highest first:
+ creating new modules and types completely C++-Side
+ expression proxy, access to meta features via C++
+ julia-side wrapper for C++ Functions, similar to `@ccall`
+ save-states, restoring a previous julia state
+ clang support
+ julia-side macro expansion during C++ compile time

# Dependencies

`jluna` aims to be as modern as is practical. It uses C++20 features extensively and aims to support the newest Julia version, rather than focusing on backwards compatibility. If you are looking for a C++ library that supports julia 1.5 or lower, consider checking out [CxxWrap](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/CxxWrap.jl) instead.

For `jluna` you'll need:
+ **Julia 1.7.0** (or higher)
+ **g++10** (or higher)
  - including `-fconcepts`
+ **cmake 3.19** (or higher)
+ unix-based operating system

Currently, only g++10 is supported though Clang support is planned in the future.

# Installation

`jluna` is header only, to add it to your application, simply use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Clemapfel/jluna.git
```

or if you already have a library:
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/Clemapfel/jluna.git
```

then link against `jluna` in your `CMakeList.txt` like so:
```CMAKE
include_directories("/path/to/.../jluna/")
add_executable(MY_EXECUTABLE path/to/my/main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(MY_EXECUTABLE jluna)
```
---

## Troubleshooting

### cmake julia executable cannot find julia

`jluna` detects your julia version and build parameters using the `julia` command in bash, if this command is not available on a system level, you will need to manually supply the path for the julia executable to `jluna`. To do this:

Open `jluna/CMakeLists.txt` in an editor and modify the following statement in line 10:

```cmake
10: set(JULIA_EXECUTABLE /path/to/your/.../julia/bin/julia) # add the path to julia here 
```

During `make` jluna should now be able to determine all the information to build jluna and link julia properly

### State::initialize() fails

jluna assumes that `julia` is installed on a system level. If this is not the case, you will need to manually specify the path to your image during the initialization step in C++. when calling `jluna::State::initialize()` at the start of your C++ main, instead of the no-argument call, use this overload and provide the full path to your julia image like so:

```cpp
jluna::State::initialize("/path/to/your/.../julia/bin");
```

Make sure that the image is uncompressed as `.zip` or `.tar` files cannot be used for initialization.

## Documentation

A full manual that introduces all major features in `jluna` step-by-step is available [here](/docs/docs.md). If you feel like you don't have the time or you're just here remind yourself of specific syntax, feel free to consult this example `main.cpp`:

```cpp
#include <jluna.hpp>

using namespace jluna;
int main()
{
  // always initialize first
  jluna::State::initialize();
}
```
